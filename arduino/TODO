- slides aduino firmware + FTDI vs ISP programmer (+ snippets and commands for each of the following cases)

- Arduino sketches (simplified language)
- Install / remove firmware (add this in slides)
- GCC/G++ + Arduino libraries with ISP programmer (with scritp/make/cmake)
- GCC/G++ without Arduino libraries with ISP programmer (with scritp/make/cmake)
- ASM with ISP programmer
- GCC/G++ without Arduino libraries directly on AVR chip (ie. without Adruino hardware) with ISP programmer (with scritp/make/cmake)
- ASM directly on AVR chip (ie. without Adruino hardware) with ISP programmer
