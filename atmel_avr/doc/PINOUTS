PIN DESCRIPTIONS

VCC
 Digital supply voltage.

GND
 Ground.

Port B (PB7:0) XTAL1/XTAL2/TOSC1/TOSC2
 Port B is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The
 Port B output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source
 capability. As inputs, Port B pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up
 resistors are activated. The Port B pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active,
 even if the clock is not running.
 Depending on the clock selection fuse settings, PB6 can be used as input to the inverting Oscil-
 lator amplifier and input to the internal clock operating circuit.
 Depending on the clock selection fuse settings, PB7 can be used as output from the inverting
 Oscillator amplifier.
 If the Internal Calibrated RC Oscillator is used as chip clock source, PB7..6 is used as TOSC2..1
 input for the Asynchronous Timer/Counter2 if the AS2 bit in ASSR is set.
 The various special features of Port B are elaborated in “Alternate functions of port B” on page
 78 and “System clock and clock options” on page 27.

Port C (PC5:0)
 Port C is a 7-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The
 PC5..0 output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source
 capability. As inputs, Port C pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up
 resistors are activated. The Port C pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active,
 even if the clock is not running.

PC6/RESET
 If the RSTDISBL Fuse is programmed, PC6 is used as an I/O pin. Note that the electrical char-
 acteristics of PC6 differ from those of the other pins of Port C.
 If the RSTDISBL Fuse is unprogrammed, PC6 is used as a Reset input. A low level on this pin
 for longer than the minimum pulse length will generate a Reset, even if the clock is not running.
 The minimum pulse length is given in Table 29-3 on page 307. Shorter pulses are not guaran-
 teed to generate a Reset.
 The various special features of Port C are elaborated in “Alternate functions of port C” on page 81.

Port D (PD7:0)
 Port D is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The
 Port D output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source
 capability. As inputs, Port D pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up
 resistors are activated. The Port D pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active,
 even if the clock is not running.
 The various special features of Port D are elaborated in “Alternate functions of port D” on page 84.

AVCC
 AVCC is the supply voltage pin for the A/D Converter, PC3:0, and ADC7:6. It should be externally
 connected to VCC, even if the ADC is not used. If the ADC is used, it should be connected to VCC
 through a low-pass filter. Note that PC6..4 use digital supply voltage, VCC.

AREF
 AREF is the analog reference pin for the A/D Converter.
