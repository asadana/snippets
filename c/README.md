# C Snippets

## Description

This is a collection of original C snippets, i.e. small pieces of code I have
written to test specific aspects of the C programming language and various C
programming libraries.

### Scientific programming libraries

- The [c/gsl](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/c/gsl) directory contains some snippets on the [GSL (GNU Scientific Library)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) programming libraries.
- The [c/glpk]() and [science/glpk](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/science/glpk) directories contain some snippets on [GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/), a linear programming (LP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) solver.

### Parallel computing and high performance computing

- The [c/mpi](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/c/mpi) directory contains some snippets on [MPI (Message Passing Interface)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) for the C/C++ programming language.
- The [openmp](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/openmp) directory contains some snippets on [OpenMP](http://openmp.org), an API for parallel programming.

### Image processing programming libraries

- The [c/opencv](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/c/opencv) directory contains some snippets on the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) image processing library for the C programming language.

### Programming tools

- The [make/c](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/c/hello) and [make/cpp](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/hello) directories contain some snippets on [Gnu Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/), the famous multi-language build system.
- The [cmake](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cmake) directory contains some snippets on [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), the powerful cross-platform build system.

### Embedded Systems Programming

- The [atmel_mega_avr](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/atmel_mega_avr) directory contains some snippets on the [Atmel ATMega AVR micro-controller programming (in C)](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/).
- The [c/rpi]() and [python/rpi]() directories contain some snippets on the [Raspberry Pi GPIO libraries](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) for the Raspberry Pi embedded platform (written in C and Python).

### Graphical User Interface libraries

- The [c/gtk](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/c/gtk) and [python/pygtk](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/python/pygtk) directories contain some snippets on the [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/) graphical user interfaces (C and Python).

### 2D, 3D and Multimedia libraries

- The [c/cairo]() and [python/cairo](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/python/cairo) directories contain some snippets on [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) for the C programming language and Python.
- The [c/sdl]() directory contains some snippets on [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) (Simple DirectMedia Layer), the C Multimedia Library.

### Unix programming

- The [c/unix](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/c/unix) directory contains about fifty snippets on Unix/Linux system calls in C.
- The [c/debian](), [python/debian]() and [java/debian]() directories contain some snippets on Debian packaging in C/C++, Python and Java.
