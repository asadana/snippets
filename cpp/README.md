# C++ Snippets

## Description

This is a collection of original C++ snippets, i.e. small pieces of
code I have written to test specific aspects of the C++ language and various
C++ programming libraries.

### Scientific programming libraries

- The [cpp/eigen](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/eigen) directory contains some snippets on the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) C++ template library for linear algebra.

### Image processing programming libraries

- The [cpp/opencv](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/opencv) directory contains some snippets on the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) image processing library for the C++ programming language.

### General API

- The [cpp/boost](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/boost) directory contains some snippets on the [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) C++ libraries ([Boost.Chrono](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/chrono.html), [Boost.Date_Time](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/date_time.html), [Boost.Graph](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html), [Boost.Program_options](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/program_options.html), [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/index.html), [Boost.Random](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/boost_random.html), ...).

### Programming tools

- The [make/cpp](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/hello) directory contains some snippets on [Gnu Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/), the famous multi-language build system.
- The [cmake](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cmake) directory contains some snippets on [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), the powerful cross-platform build system.

### Graphical User Interface libraries

- The [cpp/qt](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/qt) and [python/pyqt](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/python/pyqt) directories contain some snippets on the [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) C++ and Python UI framework.

### 2D, 3D and Multimedia libraries

- The [cpp/bullet](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/bullet) and [cpp/bullet_osg](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/bullet_osg) directories contain some snippets on the [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org) physics engine.
- The [cpp/osg](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/osg) directory contains some snippets on the [Open Scene Graph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) 3D graphics toolkit.
- The [cpp/sfml](https://github.com/jeremiedecock/snippets/tree/master/cpp/sfml) directory contains some snippets on the [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org) C++ Multimedia Library.
