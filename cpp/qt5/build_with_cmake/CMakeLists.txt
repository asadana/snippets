# Use the Widgets module from Qt 5.
# The recommended way to use Qt libraries and headers with CMake 2.8.11 is to
# use the target_link_libraries command. In CMake 2.8.11 and later versions,
# this command automatically adds appropriate include directories, compile
# definitions, the position-independent-code flag, and links to the qtmain.lib
# library on Windows.
