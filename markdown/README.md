# Markdown

## What is Markdown ?

    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting
    syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats
    using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme
    files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich
    text using a plain text editor." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
