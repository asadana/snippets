# OpenSCAD

## What is OpenSCAD ?

    "OpenSCAD is a free software application for creating solid 3D CAD objects.
    It is not an interactive modeler, but rather a 3D-compiler based on a
    textual description language. An OpenSCAD document specifies geometric
    primitives and defines how they are modified and manipulated to render a 3D
    model." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD)
