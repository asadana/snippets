# Warning:
# The urllib2 (from Python 2.x) module has been split across several modules in
# Python 3 named "urllib.request" and "urllib.error".
# Urllib (and thus urllib2) is part of the Python3 standard library but this is
# not the case for urllib3 !
# "urllib and urllib2 have little to do with each other. They were designed to
# be independent and standalone, each solving a different scope of problems,
# and urllib3 follows in a similar vein."

# Online documentation:
# - https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html
