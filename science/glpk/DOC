Official documentation:

    For Debian users: /usr/share/doc/glpk-doc/

    The official GLPK documentation is contained within each official GLPK distribution. The key documents are:
    PDF             Topic                               Comment
    doc/glpk.pdf    GLPK reference manual               also covers the C language application programming interface (API) 
    doc/gmpl.pdf    GNU MathProg modeling language      MathProg is sometimes known as GMPL
    doc/graphs.pdf  GLPK graph and network routines     network programming support
    doc/cnfsat.pdf  CNF-SAT problems                    special case boolean satisfiability problem support

    The same doc directory contains a number of other PDF and text files of a more specialist nature.

    These official documents change with each release to reflect developments. These documents are intentionally not available from this site in order to reduce the maintenance overhead and latency.

    GNU MathProg modeling language is a subset of AMPL therefore AMPL documentation is relevant for GMPL.
