The examples directory in the official GLPK distribution contains about 60 MathProg (as well as some application programming) examples:

    sample MathProg model (*.mod) files — with and without embedded data
    sample MathProg data (*.dat) files — external data
    sample database (*.dbf) files — table-based external data
    sample data (*.csv) files — table-based external data

For Debian users, official examples are in the following directory: /usr/share/doc/glpk-utils/examples/
